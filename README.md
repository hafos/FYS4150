# FYS4150
Repository for the Computational Physics 1 masters course at the University of Oslo.

The projects for the course are divided into different folders with their respective names.

All projects are solved in C++, so for compiling and running the code we have simply used the g++ compiler.

Code has been compiled with flag -std=c++11.

For code utilizing the armadillo c++ library the -larmadillo tag is needed when compiling.
